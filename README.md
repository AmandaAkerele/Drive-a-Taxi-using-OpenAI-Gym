# Drive-a-Taxi-using-OpenAI-Gym

## Introduction

Welcome to the Q-Learning Implementation for the "Taxi-v3" environment! This repository showcases the application of the Q-learning algorithm to a classic reinforcement learning problem using OpenAI's Gym library.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the Q-learning algorithm's behavior in the context of the "Taxi-v3" environment. The environment presents a taxi navigating a gridworld to transport passengers to their destinations.

Key Objectives:

- **Implementation**: We've coded the Q-learning algorithm using Python, employing the Gym library for the environment setup.
  
- **Training**: The agent undergoes training to learn an optimal policy that maximizes rewards over time.

- **Evaluation**: We analyze the trained agent's performance in terms of total rewards and its ability to efficiently perform tasks.

## Repository Contents

- `Q_Learning_Taxi_v3.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the detailed implementation of Q-learning for the "Taxi-v3" environment.
